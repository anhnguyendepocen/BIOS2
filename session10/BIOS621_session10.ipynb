    "* Ignoring within-subject correlations can produce very wrong results, and is not always \"conservative\"\n",
    "* Hierarchical analysis strategies are needed for any of:\n",
    "     1. When the correlation structure is of primary interest, _e.g._ familial aggregation of disease, or consistency of treatment within centers,\n",
    "     2. When we wish to “borrow strength” across the levels of a hierarchy in order to improve estimates, and\n",
    "     3. When dealing with unbalanced correlated data.  E.g., no requirement that each Georgia mother have exactly 5 children.\n",
    "* Population average models provide a robust alternative to mixed models\n",

    "2. Estimate confidence intervals for the coefficients of this model, and interpret them\n",
    "3. Calculate the ICC\n",
    "4. Create residuals plots for this model and interpret\n",
    "5. Fit population average models for the fecal fat dataset using at least two different working correlation structures. Compare the results to each other and to the mixed model"
