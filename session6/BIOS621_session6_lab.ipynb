Consider a clinical study where:\n    + patient 1 dies 1 month after diagnosis\n    + patient 2 dies 12 years after diagnosis\n    + patient 3 is lost to follow-up after 1 month\n    + patient 4 is still alive after 12 years of follow-up\n\n*Question #1: which patients are \"censored?\"*\n\n*Question #2: how would you rank these patients in order of disease severity?*\n\n# Definitions\n\n*Definition*: A survival time is said to be *right-censored* \nat time t if it is only known to be greater than t.\n\n*Definition*: The *survival function* at time t, denoted $S(t)$, is the probability of being event-free at t.  Equivalently, it is the probability that the survival time is greater than t.\n\n# leukemia Example: see leuk.csv\n* Study of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) maintenance therapy for children in remission from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n* 42 patients achieved remission from induction therapy and were then randomized in equal numbers to 6-MP or placebo.\n* Survival time studied was from randomization until relapse.\n\nSurvival times in weeks for Placebo group:"
