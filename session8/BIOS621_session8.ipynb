    "1. Does the dataset actually contain `n=424` patients as stated above?\n",
    "2. For how many patients is there complete data for `time`, `status`, and `trt`?\n",
    "3. Which variables are categorical, and which are continuous?\n",
    "4. Make a Kaplan-Meier plot for overall survival, stratified by the `trt` variable. \n",
    "5. Fit univariate Cox models for each available covariate, using a loop. Which have significant p-values (you can ignore multiple testing for now)?\n",
    "6. Fit a multivariate Cox model with `trt` and `spiders` as covariates. \n",
    "     a. Interpret the coefficients and p-values from this multivariate model. \n",
    "     b. Create a log-minus-log plots for `treatment+spiders` model. At what times, if any, does it look like there might be any violation of the proportional hazards assumption?\n",
    "7. Fit a Cox model with `trt` as a covariate while stratifying by `spiders`. Does this stratification make any relevant difference?\n",
    "8. Suppose it is hypothesized that the treatment effect is time-dependent, and changes at 5 years. Create a time-dependent covariate that is a step function at 5 years, and test this hypothesis by using an interaction term between the new time-dependent covariate and the `trt` variable, with these two covariates plus `spiders`, in the model."
